  "credentailDesc2": "When you run the mint function, the VC is minted, but why does the token keep changing every time you press the mint button? It's because we internally add a salt value and run a hash function to generate a new value for each mint.",
  "credentailDesc3": "I took the token and tried to decode it on the SD-JWT and JWT debugging site, so if you run the encode function as we know it, you can see that the frame is hidden as shown on the right. If you look at the encode state on the left, the original object is still visible. The important thing is that we only specified that it can be hidden, not that it is completely hidden.",
